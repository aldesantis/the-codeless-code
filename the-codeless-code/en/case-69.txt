Illus.0.title: 'Walk north until the mournful song of a dying sparrow reminds you of the futility of your own existence.  Then left at the Texaco.'


The old scribe [[Qi]] was tasked with assembling and
maintaining the high-level design document for a new system.
Each developer provided the scribe with his or her
contributions, but the contributions of the head monk were
returned with the subject line /Unsatisfactory./

"What is your objection?" demanded the head monk, who
was known for his impatience.

"Much of what you gave me was actual source code," said the
scribe.  "Class declarations, method bodies, long SQL
queries.  That is not our way."

"How better to document the algorithms?" asked the head monk
pointedly.  "My way distorts nothing."

The scribe considered this.

"Very well," he said finally.  "If you can convince the head
priest of my order, I will allow it."

"Tell me where this priest may be found," said the head monk,
fumbling in his robes for paper and ink.

"I can only tell you where I found him last, about three
years ago," said the scribe, thumbing through his diary.
"Ah!  Here it is:  I followed the Road of White Nettles
toward the East for two days, until I came to a stream whose
banks were swollen from a recent rain.  There I turned so
the wind was at my back, walking until two salmon leaped
from the waters.  Crossing at the next footbridge I took the
fork that pointed straight at the moon, turned right when I
came to a barefoot boy gathering sticks and then left when
the clouds blotted out the pole-star.  It was the hut with
the door standing halfway open; you can't miss it."

The head monk required no further correction.
