Master [[Banzen]] had invited fellow master [[Suku]] to his
domicile for lunch.  On the table lay two great stacks of bowls,
each several feet high.

Banzen reached up and took the topmost bowl from his stack.
It was empty save for three grains of rice.  He deftly
snapped up each grain with his chopsticks and ate them.

Suku took the topmost bowl from her own stack.
In it was only a single toasted sesame seed.  With great
difficulty she caught it between the ends of her chopsticks.

Banzen took another bowl.  At the bottom lay a morsel
of orange flesh.  "Recently," he said, "you
[[#117|advised a certain monk]] that it was wise to
structure even the smallest application."

Suku also took another bowl, discovering the tiniest sliver
of cucumber.  "I have found that with structure comes
clarity and extensibility."

"You will be pleased to hear that he is heeding your advice
most eagerly," said Banzen.  "He now divides a hundred-line
throwaway application into many classes."

"Ah," said Suku, reaching for the next bowl.  It held two grains
of rice.  "You believe I counseled him poorly."

"Injudiciously, perhaps," said Banzen, struggling to scoop
up a few dots of tobiko.  "Any virtue, taken
to extremes, becomes a vice.  Incidentally, how is your sushi?"

"Is /that/ what we're eating?" asked Suku, considering the
tall stack of bowls that still remained.

"I am not entirely certain," said Banzen, studying a
ribbon of nori at the end of his chopsticks.
"I suppose we must go through all the courses before we can be sure."
