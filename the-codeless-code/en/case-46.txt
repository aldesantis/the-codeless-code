On Monday a novice asked master [[Banzen]]: What is the
greatest aspiration?

Banzen replied: to know all that can be known, so that
one's code may never be improved upon.

On Tuesday another novice asked Banzen: What is the greatest
aspiration?

Banzen replied: to be surrounded always by
colleagues whose knowledge is more extensive,
so that one may be in a continual state of improvement.

On Wednesday a third novice observed that the answers
were mutually exclusive; indeed, they were almost exact opposites.

Banzen replied: that is so.

The novice, thinking he had the upper hand, then asked Banzen
how one should set about attaining the greatest aspiration.

Irritated, Banzen replied: on Monday I was asked the greatest
positive number; on Tuesday, the number half its size.  I
answered each question in one breath.  But if I must show
you how to count to either, the moon will turn to sand
before we have barely begun.

The novice bowed in shame and left.

A gardener -- who had been pruning the bonsai tree on Banzen's
table -- confessed that he did not understand how the
novice could be found in error, for the questions on Monday
and Tuesday were indeed identical.

Banzen replied: that bonsai needs water, as does the
oak outside my window.
