The old scribe was asked why, in his official accounts, the
temples and the clans were named but the many monks and priests
were not.

"If I gave you a sheet of figures to tally, would you first
bestow a name upon each number seven?" asked the scribe,
dismissing the questioner with a wave of an ink-stained
hand.

to find the following written in thick block letters above
the door:
