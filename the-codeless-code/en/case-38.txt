A novice asked Java master [[Banzen]], "What is the most perfect
programming language?"

The master answered, "The one which accomplishes the
desired task with the least effort expended by the user."

The novice asked, "Is there a language which exceeds all
others in this regard?"

The master answered, "Build me a garden of ten thousand
stones!"

== Qi's commentary

Management, too, has its programming languages,
although what they produce is frequently defective.

== Qi's poem

Whether or not the garden was built, //
Banzen got his desire. //
The novice came no more for counsel -- //
Words conceal intent.
