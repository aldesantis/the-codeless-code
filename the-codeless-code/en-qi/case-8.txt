A novice asked the great master: "What is the Way?"

The master replied, "Writing code is the Way."

The novice then asked, "What is not the Way?"

The master replied, "Writing code is not the Way."

The novice said, "Then the writing of code is all things."

The master replied, "And the not-writing of code also."

The novice asked, "At the present moment, are we writing
code, or not writing code?"

The master replied, "We are the code."
