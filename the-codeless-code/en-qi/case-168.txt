Illus.0.title: The more I try to be a full-stack developer in a rapidly changing enterprise setting, the more terrified I am of my own ignorance.  I'd rather do five things well than ten things poorly.


<i>When their respective apprentices had retired for the night, //
masters [[Suku]] and Yaqqana spoke beside the fire-pit //
in Yaqqana's little monastery.</i>

- - -

/Yaqqana said:/ Let us compare the ways of our temples, //
to see what we may learn from one another.

/Suku replied:/ That is agreeable.

//

/Yaqqana said:/ Our systems are built of many components, //
each layered like the earth itself: //
persistence is the stony foundation, //
business logic the fertile soil, //
presentation the fragrant blossoms //
delighting the world-wide sky.

/Suku replied:/ We do likewise.

//

/Yaqqana said:/ Our designs are guided by three principles: //
loose coupling between components, //
strong cohesion within them, //
and encapsulation always where developer meets developer.

/Suku replied:/ We think likewise.

//

/Yaqqana said:/ Our means to this end is self-evident: //
each monk is assigned one component at a time, //
coding its layers as he sees fit.

/Suku replied:/ Here you and I part ways -- for in our temple, //
each monk is assigned one layer at a time, //
yet codes across many different components.

//

/Yaqqana said:/ Our way's virtues are readily seen: //
Each component is consistent throughout, //
yet a black box to its neighbors left and right.

/Suku replied:/ Our way's virtues are likewise apparent: //
Each layer is consistent throughout, //
yet a black box to its neighbors above and below.

//

/Yaqqana said:/ Your way would kill us by stagnation -- //
for so many must speak before code is written.

/Suku replied:/ Your way would doom us by chaos -- //
for so much may be coded before anyone speaks.

//

/Yaqqana said:/ When our temple was built, //
it was on foundations of respect, //
and mutual reliance, //
and creativity, //
and independence. //
We trust even our middling monks to deliver code of quality, //
and this I would not change for anything.

/Suku replied:/ Nor would I ask you to. //
Your temple is not our temple; your needs are not our needs. //
Therefore let us agree upon one thing more, //
which is to part amicably.

//

<i>Thus did the two embrace in friendship, //
and wish each other pleasant dreams.</i>

- - -

<i>But when Yaqqana had retired, and Suku was alone, //
she whispered to the dying fire:</i>

When your temple was built, //
did masons cut the foundation stones? //
and did carpenters hew the beams? //
and did plumbers lay the pipes? //
and did roofers set the tiles? //
Or did a hundred middling laborers choose one room each, //
and build it entire from earth to sky?
