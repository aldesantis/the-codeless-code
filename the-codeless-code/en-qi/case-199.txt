Master [[Banzen]] was approached by his apprentice
[[Djishin]], who said: "The Temple needs a REST library
with JSON support.  I have located several third-party
candidates, but I do not know how to choose among them."

Banzen seemed taken aback.  "Did you not author
such a library yourself, and provide it to the [[Spider Clan]]?"

"Yes," said Djishin, "but now it is a stone around my neck.
Every week the Spider Clan requests some new feature or
files a bug report, claiming the utmost urgency.  And
whenever /anything/ goes wrong with our webservices I am
summoned to investigate whether my code is the culprit!  The
story is the same for all the other libraries I have
provided to our Temple.  May I live ten thousand years and
never write another!"

That afternoon Banzen went to the abbess Jinyu, saying:

"I wasted years trying to quell Djishin's desire to write
his own frameworks instead of acquiring well-known
ones.{{*}} Time and again I showed him how his solutions
were too ambitious, or too inflexible, or too insecure.
Yet in the end he has been swayed not by my
teachings, but by the pain of responsibility!  Had I let him
release his pitiful code to the Temple when he first became
my apprentice I'd have saved myself a lifetime's worth of
bother!"

"The prolific developer may appear to enjoy work, yet that
is not always so," said Jinyu.  "Everyone has tasks they
enjoy and tasks they abhor.  Djishin's fault was that he was
too lazy to look for solutions farther away than the tips of
his fingers.  /Your/ fault was that /you/ never looked past
his Outer Industriousness to discover the Inner Laziness
from which it came.  Thankfully, Djishin's former master
warned me of the monk's flaw before I took him in."

Banzen's jaw dropped open.  "Why did you not mention this
years ago?"

Jinyu rapped Banzen on the head with her cane.  "Why did
you never climb the steps to my office and ask my advice?
Do not trouble my ears about Djishin -- he learned
/well/ from your example."
