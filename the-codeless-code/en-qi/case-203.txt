A certain senior monk found himself in need of more
developers to meet his project's deadline.  He asked the
clan abbot for help.

Said the abbot: Let us go to [[Tongshing]] the Project Manager;
for he is wise in the ways of Customer Relationships, and
can advise us on how best to approach our client.

After hearing their desires, the Project Manager unfolded a
morning newspaper.  He turned to the page on which the day's
astrological forecasts were printed, scrutinized it, frowned
and said: today is not a propitious day.  Consult me again
tomorrow.

The next day, and the day after, and the day after that, the
monk and the abbot returned to the Project Manager for
counsel.  Each time, the Project Manager unfolded his paper,
shook his head, and told the pair to return tomorrow.

But on the fifth day, Tongshing said: if you each don robes
of crimson, today will be a most propitious day to ask your
client for more money.

The monk and the abbot did as they were told, and returned
to the Temple with a pouch full of silver coins.  Later, the
monk went to the Project Manager and said: I cannot argue with
success, but your methods are most unorthodox.  In an
Enlightened Age such as ours, how did you come to believe in
astrology?

I do not, said the Project Manager.  But your client does,
and he subscribes to this same newspaper.
