Illus.0.title: I'll just stick that "Standards and Practices" book right here, between "The Plumber's Encyclopedia of Pipe Fittings" and "1001 Gum Diseases (Color Illustrated)".

The old scribe [[Qi]] was summoned to a meeting with two senior
abbots.

The first abbot said, "Developers are ignoring our many
Standards and Practices documents.  We have checked the
files in to a project in the source repository; no one
downloads it.  We have made PDF links available on a special
web page; no one visits it.  We have painstakingly copied
the content into a wiki; no one browses it."

The second abbot said, "We are now considering /printing out/
the entire set, and binding it as a book.  We would
place one copy on each developer's desk.  What is your
opinion?"

"Bind them in white paper," said the scribe.  "When a year
has passed, the thick dust will not show as readily."

"We wish developers to /use/ them," said the first abbot.

"Ah!" said the scribe.  "Then bind them in red paper, for
when the nights grow cold they will burn more cheerily."

"We wish developers to /read/ them," said the second abbot.

"Then let me know how you achieve this!" said the scribe.
"For I have never found a way to make anyone read anything
against their will."

"Why do you play the fool instead of helping?!" shouted
the first abbot.

/"Wú,"/, said the scribe.  "You brought in wild dogs who
have ruined three sofas, and now you're asking me what color
the fourth should be.  I keep telling you: it is not the
furniture that needs to be changed."
