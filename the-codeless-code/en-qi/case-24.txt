Topics: null, testing

In the annals of the [[Temple of the Morning Brass Gong]], this
is recorded in the chapter titled /Unit Testing/:

Java master [[Kaimu]] would occasionally answer questions with
the single word /null./  When asked what this meant, he
would invariably reply with the same, impenetrable /null./

A young monk, of a solitary and sickly nature, began
taking note of which questions elicted this response.  These
he copied into a small red notebook, whose pages grew quite
full over the months.  The monk was observed to meditate
over this notebook late into the night.

"Have you unlocked the mind of your beloved
master Kaimu yet?" taunted his brothers one day.

/"Null,"/ said the monk.

At this, the other monks held him fast and kicked him until
he was well bruised.  His precious red book they tossed into
the fire.

The Java master heard this, and told the clan's abbot to
investigate.  "Here are forty-eight questions for the young
monk," said the master.  "Report his answers to me."

The abbot did this.  For most of the questions the monk
gave a plain answer.  For several, he responded with the
enigmatic /null./  For the remainder, he was silent.

The Java master stroked his beard as he examined the paper
given him by the abbot.

"For his answer to question twelve, box the monk's ears; for
he was insolent," said the master.  "For his answer to
question thirty-one, whip his backside with a willow-wand;
for he prevaricated.  Then provide him with another red
notebook."

"And what of the brothers who beat him?" asked the abbot.

"Reward them, for they have done a service to the temple.
I now know the algorithm of the monk to be flawed."
