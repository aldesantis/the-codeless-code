Master [[Suku]] was inspecting the [[Spider Clan]]'s code
base when she called a certain monk into her chamber.

Said Suku: "We display warnings in bold red text throughout
our many applications.  How is this done?"

The monk replied: "In our shared stylesheet I have created a
CSS class for this express purpose, named /boldRedText/."

Said Suku: "A most memorable name.  Sadly, the provincial governor
wishes his applications to promote a mood of tranquility.  See that
all warning text is rendered in a pale italic violet."

The monk bowed and exited.

Suku later inspected the monk's work and discovered that he
had renamed the style to /paleItalicVioletText/,
changing references to it in hundreds of JSPs.
She called the monk in again.

Said Suku: "The provincial governor is a most particular
man, and has decided that the display of warnings in deep
blue text of normal weight upon a gray background would be
infinitely more soothing.  See that the changes are made."

The monk bowed and exited.

Suku later inspected the monk's work and discovered that he
had renamed the style to /deepNormalBlueOnGrayText/, again making the
necessary changes far and wide in the code base.
She called the monk in again.

Said Suku: "The provincial governor is a most fickle man,
and has decided that the display of warnings in italic
rose-red text with underlines on a cream background would spur
the user into corrective action.  See that the changes are
made."

The monk bowed and exited.

- - -

Suku later inspected the monk's work and discovered that,
this time, he had /not/ changed the name of the style in his
many JSPs.  Instead only the solitary definition of
/deepNormalBlueOnGrayText/ had been changed, so that it now
produced italic rose-red text with underlines on a cream
background.  Suku sighed and called the monk in again.

When the monk entered her chambers Suku let fly several shuriken
that pinned the surprised monk's robes to the wooden door.
One blade had come dangerously close to permanently altering his
private life.

Suku turned back to her keyboard, saying:
"Consider that your final /boldRedText/."
