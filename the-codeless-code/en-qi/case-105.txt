Illus.0.title: Actually, he burned the maps because the Temple gave him a phone with GPS.  But you get the point.

A young nun approached master [[Banzen]] and said:

"When first presented with requirements I created a rough
design document, as is our way.

"When the rough design was approved I began a detailed
design document, as is our way.  In so doing I realized that
my rough design was ill-considered, and thus I discarded it.

"When the detailed design was approved I began coding, as is
our way.  In so doing I realized that my detailed design was
ill-considered, and thus I discarded it.

"My question is this:

"Since we must refactor according to need, and since all
needs are known only when implementation is underway,
can we not simply write code and nothing else?  Why must we
waste time creating design documents?"

Banzen considered this.  Finally he nodded, saying:

"There is no more virtue in the documents than in a handful
of leaves: you may safely forgo producing either one.
Before master Mugen crossed the Uncompiled Wasteland he made
eight fine maps of the route he planned to take.  Yet when
he arrived at the temple gates he burned them on the spot."

The nun took her leave in high spirits, but as she reached
the threshold Banzen barked: "Nun!"

When the nun turned around, Banzen said:

"Mugen was only able to burn the maps because he had arrived."
