The most sensitive implementation tasks were often trusted
to masters only, and one such task had just been assigned to young
master [[Zjing]].

"It is a critical webservice endpoint, which must be ready
by tomorrow morning," explained master [[Banzen]]. "I have
emailed you my notes on how it should behave."

Zjing labored in her little hut throughout the night. But as
dawn approached she noticed something amiss: if the backend
threw an unchecked exception, Banzen wanted her to catch it
and return a status of SERVICE_ERROR.

"Either his knowledge of our protocols is woefully lacking,
or his notes were made in too much haste," said Zjing to
herself.  "For I have implemented a dozen such services, and
we return <i>SYSTEM</i>_ERROR in this case."

She began an email to the Temple masters, requesting
permission to make the change, when she stopped herself:

"It will be hours before this is seen.  Am I so full of
self-doubt that I will jeopardize our schedule, sitting on
my hands until my elders tell me what I already know?  What
kind of master behaves thusly?  And think of the dishonor it
would bring on poor Banzen, to have his mistake be known!
How true the saying: when time is short, it /is/ easier to
beg forgiveness than permission."

The following midnight, the entire [[Clan of Iron Bones]]
was awakened by their cellphones beeping CRITICAL OUTAGE.
Host master [[Yishi-Shing]] woke the nun [[Hwídah]] to help
investigate.

"I have traced the problem to Zjing's new code," explained a
bleary-voiced Hwídah on the conference call.  "Her
webservice returned SYSTEM_ERROR when it caught
a RuntimeException."

"That is our custom," said Zjing.

"Not when the webservice is an /internal monitor/, and the
exception came from pinging a non-critical vendor site
known to be unreliable," said Banzen.
"<i>SERVICE</i>_ERROR is our custom then, Young Master...
for that would not have woken Yishi-Shing's
entire clan while they were sleeping off their three-day upgrade
marathon.  The clan was most interested in administering
your correction."

"I suppose it is fortunate that they do not know where I
live," said Zjing.

At that moment there was an angry pounding on Zjing's door.

"Ah, did you wish that kept a secret?" asked Banzen.
"I /do/ beg your forgiveness."
