Illus.0.title: I put two rabbits in the box, and eight came out.  I'm pretty sure that wasn't mentioned in the documentation.

A monk of the [[Elephant's Footprint Clan]] found that his
new service method was failing to update the database,
although no exceptions were thrown.  He sought the help of
Java master [[Bawan]].

After a brief investigation, Bawan declared, "Your
Service's auto-generated proxy object is not committing the
transaction because the /Transactional/ annotation was
placed on a private helper method, instead of on the
public interface method which calls it."

"I do not understand," said the monk. "What is this 'proxy
object' that you speak of?"

Bawan eyed the monk suspiciously.
"Describe to me how commits and rollbacks are done by the
AOP framework."

The monk shrugged.  "They are done automatically."

Bawan smacked the monk on the head.  "If I ask you how the
Emperor's magician makes rabbits disappear, will you answer:
'by magic'?  Think before speaking, or I will show you how I
make monks disappear."

The monk rubbed his head.  "Should we not expect a third-party
framework to liberate us from the need to know its internals?
What of the Principle of the Black Box?"

Bawan reached behind the monk's left ear, produced a
wooden spoon out of thin air, and hit the monk with that
too.  "When a rabbit is placed inside the Black Box and
vanishes on cue, it is the audience's privilege to simply
/ooh/ and /aah/ in wonderment.  But we who step on
stage should know how the trick is done.
The loss of innocence is the price of applause."
