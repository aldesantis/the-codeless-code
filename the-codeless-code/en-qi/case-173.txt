Title: Lost Peer


<i>From "The Courtship of Eku and Mugen":</i> {{1}}

There was a time, as ancient logs recall, //
when you and I would Handshake every morn //
through packets on an Ether-network borne //
our love conveyed by formal Protocol.

So high was your availability, //
a timeout span in minutes would I set -- //
secure that neither POST nor PUT nor GET //
would e’er a 504 return to me.

And when your subnet’s firewall arose, //
you bade its router map a secret port //
through which we could clandestinely consort -- //
a backdoor assignation, undisclosed.

Discreetly you’d a server-socket bind //
to listen at your gate for my connect //
But if this host address be still correct, //
Then why resounding silence do I find?

My every last connection is refused, //
my buffered input streams have all run dry, //
the root nodes of our JSON trees I spy //
now withered on the heap; they die unused.

Oh! Where can you have gone, beloved peer? //
A segmentation fault?  A kill-dash-9? //
No, say you live!  And if the fault be mine, //
I'll every line rewrite 'til you appear.

'Til then /i/ iterate from one to /n/ //
Yet never take exception when I fail //
but catch myself, and log, and weep, and wail, //
then sleep an interval, and try again.

Thus furtively alone at night I'll SYN //
and dream that you will send some answer back -- //
Oh, SYN with me!  And promise we shall ACK //
until we both lie sated, kiss... and FIN.

I'll seek thee there with netcat minus-z! //
I'll seek thee here with netstat minus-t! //
Let others mock my hopeless loyalty -- //
They only serve who serve HTTP.



== Qi's Commentary

Mugen liked to code in poetry.  Presumably, the seventh stanza
is meant to convey an algorithm like this:

<pre>
    SocketAddress sockAddr = new InetSocketAddress(host, port);
    for (int i = 1; i <= N_TRIES; i++) {
        try {
            client.connect(sockAddr, TIMEOUT_MILLIS);
            return client;
        }
        catch (Exception e) {
            log.warning("weep, wail");
            Thread.sleep(INTERVAL_MILLIS);
        }
    }
    throw new IOException("give up");
</pre>

It is theorized that his ten-thousand-stanza epic, /The Dromedary/,
describes a Perl-to-OCaml converter written in C++.
No scholar can stay sane long enough to be certain.
