On their first day in the temple, the Java master posed the
following three questions to the novices:

"Oftimes, when we acquire a new language or library, the
first program we write is /Hello, World/.  Its
purpose is to inscribe these words in some fashion that will
demonstrate the expected behavior of the technology.  After
this is done, the program is never run again.

"Now: why does it say /hello/, and not also /goodbye/?

"And: why say hello to the /world/, when the audience is but
a single soul who will discard it after its first cry
is uttered?

"And: why should it utter a greeting, which will
never be answered in kind?"

//
Speak me a word which means /hello/ and /goodbye/ -- //
is it not the first cry of an infant? //
//
Find me a pinnacle from which the world may be seen -- //
in whose eye, then, is reflected every tiger, //
and the desert of endless sand?
