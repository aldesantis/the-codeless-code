A certain monk of the [[Clan of Iron Bones]] approached host
master [[Yishi-Shing]], saying: "A thousand pardons, master,
but ever since last week's operating system upgrade I have
not been able to bring up our backup disk array."

Yishi-Shing asked, "What have you tried, other than
pestering me?"

The monk said: "I have contacted the disk vendor -- they say
our new system is not supported.  I have pored through their
documentation -- it is next to useless.  I have scoured the
web for others in my situation -- none can be found.  I have
begged for help in online forums -- not a single reply have
I received."

Yishi-Shing said: "Show me this 'begging for help'."

The monk opened his laptop and indicated his many polite
pleas for assistance.  Indeed, all were unanswered.

Yishi-Shing shook his head.  "Then we have our answer."

The master took the laptop from the monk's hands and
cross-posted the following to a dozen message boards:

     <b>**WARNING**</b> Thundering Elephant's 24-terabyte disk arrays
     CANNOT be mounted under Petulant Penguin kernel 89!
     No workaround is possible!  AVOID THIS SETUP!!!

Yishi-Shing then closed the laptop and walked away, humming.

That evening the master summoned the monk and asked him
what news.

The monk opened his laptop.  "Five separate posters have
each called me a blithering idiot and offered a simple
solution to my problem, which they claim to have tested on
their own systems."

Yishi-Shing nodded.  "My walk once took me past a beggar
whose sign read, /You do not DARE throw coins at ME!/
His body was purple with bruises but his bowl was always full."
