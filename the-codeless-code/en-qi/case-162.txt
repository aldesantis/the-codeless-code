Master [[Banzen]] was in a neighboring province, visiting an
abbot whose brethren had recently won a development contract
away from a incumbent.

"It has proven to be a hollow victory," lamented the abbot
as he poured the tea.  "The code we inherited is a towering
mountain of dung, where even the slightest prod buries us up
to our eyeballs in a landslide of manure festering with
null-pointer exceptions."

"I /am/ eating," the master said.

"Little wonder that our predecessors were unable to make
even the slightest modification without weeks of effort!"
continued the abbot.  "Little wonder the governor's patience
was at an end!  We should refactor, but I do not know
even where to begin, or how to verify that we have not
broken anything in the process."

"Where are the requirements?" asked the master.

"There are none," said the abbot.  "The governor's habit is
to dictate each change as the mood strikes him.  He says that, by
definition, whatever the code is doing right now is
correct."

Banzen sipped his tea.  "It is?  Then all my sympathies go
to the governor, and none to you!  That poor man!  Twice now -- and at no
small expense -- he has contracted an entire abbey to build
software for the express purpose of making him miserable.
You should /thank/ your predecessors for their admirable
foundation."
