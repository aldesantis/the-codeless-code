A certain monk had an odd method of writing code.  When
presented with a problem, he would first write many
automated tests to verify that the yet-unwritten code was
correct.  These would of course fail, as there was nothing
yet to test.  Only when the tests were done would the monk
work on the desired code itself, proceeding diligently until
all tests passed.

His brothers ridiculed this process, which caused the monk
to produce only half as much application code as his peers
-- and even then only after a long delay.
They called him /Luohou/, the Backwards Monk.

Java master [[Banzen]] heard of this.
"I will investigate," he declared.

Upon his return, the master decreed that all members of the
clan who were done with the week's assignments could
accompany him to the swimming hole as reward for their
efficiency.  The Backwards Monk stayed behind, alone.

At the top of the diving cliff, the eldest of the monks
peered over the edge and shrank back.

"Master!" he cried.  "Someone has scattered the stones
of the dam!  The swimming hole is empty of water.
Only weeds and sharp rocks await us below!"

With his staff Banzen prodded the youth forward towards the
precipice.

"Surely," said the master, "you can solve that problem when
you reach the bottom."
