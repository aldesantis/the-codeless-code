Illus.0.title: I have asked them how we might best achieve our deadline, but all they do is advise me to travel a highway paved in bricks of a saffron hue...

Java master [[Suku]] entered the chambers of the [[Spider Clan]]'s
new head abbot, who had been appointed to the
position after his predecessor mysteriously
<a href="/case/61">went missing.</a>

Suku said to the abbot: "Last month I was ordered to
completely re-implement the data visualization module.  I
requested seven developers with various specialities so that
the overhaul could be accomplished in one iteration.  Today
I emerged from my quarters to find twenty-one strange little
monks waiting for me in the hall."

With great enthusiasm, the abbot replied: "Are they not
marvelous?  We found them in a distant province which was
recently beset by famine or earthquakes or giant red beetles;
I forget the specifics.  They eat sparingly, sleep
only two hours a night, and they are willing to forgo
cubicles and code while dangling from the rafters, so they will
incur very little overhead.  With such a team you should be
able to make up the lost time, and complete the seven weeks'
work in a mere seven days."

Suku sighed, put two fingers to her mouth, and blew a shrill
whistle.  At the sound a dozen tiny robed figures jumped
from the rafters onto the stunned abbot, knocking him
unconscious.

The abbot awoke in a dark stone pit with a single candle
burning by his side.  As his eyes adjusted to the gloom he
discovered a rat-scoured skeleton in abbot's robes, on which
was pinned a note:

    Above you lies a square trap door: //
    sturdy, yet light and unlocked. //
    To aid your exit I have attached the best hinges -- //
    Seven along each edge.
