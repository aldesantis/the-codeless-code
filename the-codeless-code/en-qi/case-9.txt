Two monks of the [[Spider Clan]] were arguing whether the new
input validation routine was caught in an infinite loop.

"How long has it been running?" asked the abbot.

"No more than thirty minutes," said the pale thin monk.

"Yet no less than that either," said the dark fat monk.

"And you have done nothing this whole time but wait for it
to complete?" asked the abbot.

The monks bowed their heads in shame.

The abbot reported this to the Java master, who nodded.
"Which of them believes that the loop is /not/
infinite?"

"The pale thin one," said the abbot.

"Then give him a skin of wine, for he is wise.  No loop may
be truly infinite.  Someday the power will fail, the server
will rust, the temple will crumble, and the sun will
swallow the earth."

Asked the abbot, "What of the dark fat one, who believes
that the loop is infinite?"

"Give him two skins of wine, for he is wiser.  To the user
waiting at his browser, ten seconds is agony, a minute is an
aeon, and anything longer is effectively an eternity.  When
the tiger mauls the antelope, the antelope does not question
whether eight claws were used, or a million."
