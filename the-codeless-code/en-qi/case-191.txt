Master [[Bawan]] came upon a monk struggling with the photocopy
machine.  The monk was jabbing buttons in frustration, but
the copier sat silent.

Bawan shooed the boy away, saying: "Machines can sense
desperation.  It unsettles them."  The master calmly pressed
buttons one by one, pausing to breathe between each.  The
machine chugged to life, and the desired copies began to
appear.

The monk asked, "How is it that so simple a thing can sense
the subtleties of emotion?"

Bawan replied, "The lake knows when the wind is angry, for
she wrinkles her face and slaps the shore."

The monk considered this.

At length he said, "When the physician senses my
distress, she attends to my needs.  The designers of this
machine's user interface would do well to follow her example."

Bawan raised a finger. "Even the finest physician will give you no
relief if you only howl in pain and rend your garments.
Instead, draw a deep breath and try the Four Words of
Distress."

The monk asked, "What are these 'Four Words'?"

The master said, "From least to greatest comfort given, they
are: /Help/, /Cancel/, and /Undo/.  Offer them all to users
of your own interfaces, and when they have departed
they will say, ‘Here labors a physician of supreme
compassion, who understands our fallibilities and
spares us from self-harm!’"

The monk said, "You spoke of but three words.  What is the
fourth?"

Bawan hit the /Off/ button and went out.
