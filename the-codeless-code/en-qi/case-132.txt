Illus.0.title: Yesterday she danced the Perl regex interpreter, and it took two paramedics to untangle her arms and legs.

Being snowed in together through the winter months will
strain even the closest of friendships; [[Yíwen]] and
[[Hwídah]] were no exception to this rule.

Hwídah was irritated enough when her lanky roommate began
dancing silently around their quarters, swinging her 
arms and legs within inches of Hwídah's nose.  But Hwídah's
patience came to an end one day when Yíwen set up an
electric guzheng{{1}} in the center of the room and began
playing it -- or rather, began plucking its strings
inexpertly to produce a series of dissonant, tuneless,
tempoless sounds.  The interlude lasted a minute, after
which Yíwen sat down and scribbled on some papers.  But then
she rose and repeated the performance.

After the tenth iteration, Hwídah hurled a sandal
right into Yíwen's backside, causing the girl to yelp and
turn around.

<i>"What,"</i> growled Hwídah, <i>"are you doing?"</i>

Some of Yíwen's papers fluttered to the floor.  Hwídah
snatched them up.  They were printouts of quicksort
implemented in different languages: C, Lisp, Perl, even
Prolog.  Each was covered with musical
notations in red ink.

"A thousand pardons for my rudeness," said Yíwen.  "I have
been attempting to encode certain algorithms as
movements through space, or notes in the air.
If the result is not pleasing I change my encoding and
try again."

"Why?" asked Hwídah.

"To see what I will discover by doing it," answered Yíwen.
"We speak often of the beauty or elegance of code.  Perhaps,
without knowing it, we have been composing choreographies
for information to dance to, and we find certain ones
pleasing because they appeal to some deeper aesthetic sense
common to other forms of human art.  If so, then these arts
would be connected.  I seek that connection."

Hwídah considered this.

"Thus far, the music of quicksort eludes me," continued
Yíwen with a sigh.  "Perhaps my experiment is as foolish as
translating songs into code and attempting to
compile it.  Perhaps the music of quicksort is best
played by machines for their own appreciation, and not ours.
Shall I quit this endeavor, and spare your nerves?"

In answer, Hwídah produced two bits of cotton from her
nightstand and put them in her ears.  Yíwen bowed and returned
to her instrument.  Thus was peace restored.
