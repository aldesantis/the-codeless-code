Illus.0.title:

In the forecourt of the temple, a monk asked master
[[Kaimu]]: How can I keep pace with all there is to know,
when technology changes faster every year?

Kaimu answered: If a thing seems important, remember it.

The monk asked: Is Kaimu always so flippant?  You might as
well say, /if a raindrop falls, drink it./ The first gentle
storm would burst my stomach!

Kaimu frowned and said: Go to the well at
the foot of the mountain.  Do not return to this temple
until you have consumed ten thousand buckets.

Dejected, the monk went to the well as he was told.  After a
full hour he had barely finished a tenth of the first
bucket, yet his bladder was so painfully swollen that he
barely made it to the woods to relieve himself.

As his body rid itself of water, the monk was enlightened.

He returned to Kaimu immediately, saying: I come only to
report a curious paradox. I have drunk my fill, but will
be thirsty tomorrow.

Kaimu replied: Have we met? If so, I have forgotten the
circumstance.

Thus did Kaimu bid the monk to re-enter the temple.
