When [[#147|this story]] reached the ears of the curious nun [[Satou]],
she sought out master [[Bawan]].

Satou said, "My master spoke of the Subtle Art of
Caching, that all Temple developers should study.  What is
this subtle art?"

Bawan replied, "A thousand fresh oranges in a distant
market; three stale ones in the bowl on my table.  What
shall I breakfast upon this month?"

Satou considered this and said, "When the bitterness of the
fruit exceeds the bitterness of the journey, we set out with
coin in hand."

Bawan replied, "My brother keeps raisins in his bowl; my
sister keeps uncooked fish.  How often shall we three set
out for market?  With how many bowls, and at what time of
day?"

Satou said, "Such simple questions, yet to answer any I must
ask more."

Bawan replied, "And I may answer each of your questions
with more of my own."

Satou asked, "Is it this complexity that makes caching
a Subtle Art?"

Bawan shook his head.  "Complexity only makes it an art.  It
is the apparent simplicity that makes it subtle.  How simple
it is to declare a static hashtable, and yet how perilous!
The first challenge of a Subtle Art is recognizing that it
even exists in the first place."
