The timid nun [[Yíwen]] opened several source files she had
authored barely a year ago, only to find unrecognizable code
within.  After inspecting their revision history she
approached the cubicle of her longtime companion.

"A thousand pardons, [[Hwídah]]," she began, "but it appears that
you have completely rewritten my address-management service.
Why did you find this necessary?"

"The code was uncharacteristically complex and
unintuitive," answered Hwídah gently.  "You created many more
interfaces than necessary, nested value objects inside of
other value objects, defined abstract classes which have
only one concrete implementation, and performed database
updates in two separate transactions where one would have
sufficed.  I have simplified the structure."

Yíwen bowed humbly, gave her thanks, and walked out.

The following morning Hwídah approached the cubicle of her
longtime companion, bearing a beautiful steel
contraption.  She dropped it noisily onto
Yíwen's desk.

"I found this waiting for me when I awoke this morning,"
said Hwídah.  "Explain."

"Your old spinning-wheel was uncharacteristically complex
and unintuitive -- do you not agree?" asked Yíwen.  "You
used many more gears than necessary, placed the fiber basket
in a poor location, padded the stands but not the hand
cranks, and used two separate flywheels where one would have
sufficed.  I have simplified the mechanics."

Hwídah bowed humbly, gave her thanks, and walked out.

She then went straight away to master [[Yishi-Shing]], saying,
"Regrettably, I will not be able to participate in your clan's
weekly bicycle rides anytime soon."
