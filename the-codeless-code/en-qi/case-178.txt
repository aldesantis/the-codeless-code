A nasty stomach flu had been making its way through the
Temple.  Fully half the [[Spider Clan]] had fallen victim,
so to meet deadlines the monk [[Wangohan]] had been forced
to team with his longtime nemesis, the monk [[Landhwa]].

To avoid conflicts that might lead to
[[#84|yet another incapacitated developer]],
their [[#174|newly appointed]] master-in-training [[Zjing]]
decided that they should work in separate shifts --
Landhwa by day, Wangohan by night.

"Finally," said Zjing on the videoconferencing monitor,
"we cannot risk delays caused by arguments over coding
style.  But neither do I wish to have two separate styles in
one application.  Therefore, as Wangohan is new to this
project, he will follow Landhwa's style as precisely as
possible."

Wangohan bowed his assent and took his leave to rest before
the night's work.

When night fell, Wangohan began to familiarize himself with
Landhwa's source code.  He was pleased to see that there
were no magic literals, but pleasure turned to horror when
he discovered that every constant in the application --
regardless of purpose -- had been declared in a single,
huge, uncommented /Constants.java/ file:

|  ...
   public static final String HELP = "HELP";
   public static final String HELP2 = "Need help?";
   public static final String HELPU = "/help";
   public static final String HELPTA = "{{help}}";
   public static final String HELPTB = "${help}";
   public static final String HTTP = "HTTP";
   public static final String HTTPU = "http://";
   public static final String HTTPS = "https";
   ...


Wangohan was about to refactor the file when he remembered
Zjing's decree.  Not wishing to disrespect the nascent
authority of his longtime friend, Wangohan lifted his fingers
from the keyboard and scowled at the monitor for a long
time.

In the morning, Landhwa found a message waiting for him
from Wangohan:

    All has been coded according to your example.

Landhwa pulled the latest changes from the repository and found
that nearly every source file had disappeared.  Only two remained.
The first Landhwa recognized; the second was but a few hours old:

|   Constants.java            48K
    Code.java               8090K
