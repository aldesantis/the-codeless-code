Two priests of the [[Seven-Clawed Blind Eagle Clan]] found Java
master [[Banzen]] sobbing at his keyboard.  They asked what
ailed him so.

"The code of this monk is abysmal," said the master.  "The
package structure is unintuitive, the class names
undescriptive, the methods overly complex, and the comments
entirely useless.  For the last ten years he has attended
every lecture I have given, and in truth he has followed my
instructions to the letter.  Yet the fruits of his
labors are unpalatable in the extreme."

The first priest looked over the code.  "Certainly,
correction is in order.  I suggest that you begin with a
simple whipping."

The master sighed and nodded, lowering the drape of his robe
to bare his shoulders.
