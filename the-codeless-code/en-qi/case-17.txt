A monk of the [[Elephant's Footprint Clan]] had been charged with
eliminating the reams of redundant code created by that
clan.  He approached the clan's head priest for guidance.

"Here, for example, are five schemes for managing user
preferences," said the monk, spreading the printouts on the
table.  "I must either pick the superior one or
implement some compromise.  Either way at least four modules
will be tossed into the fire, and their authors ordered
to consume the code of a rival."

"Then you are doomed," said the priest.  "Once the cat wets her
paw to rake a carp from the pool, she will not trade the
belly for ten thousand mice."

The monk wiped a hand across his brow.  "And this is but one
of a dozen redundant subsystems I must consolidate!  Today I
saw one of the senior brothers sharpening his
throwing-knives.  Is there no way that the monks of our clan
might be mollified?"

The priest held up his left hand, which was missing the
smallest finger.  "If the cat cannot have the carp, a
bit of the carp-thief will suffice."
