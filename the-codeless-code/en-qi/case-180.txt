Snow still covered the temple grounds when a senior nun
happened upon the old monk [[Shinpuru]] clearing dead stalks
from his garden.  Soon their talk turned to matters
befitting two old warriors.

"I liked our profession better in my youth," said the
nun. "In those days my temple was a simple place, where work
was pleasant and mastery came easy.  All we needed were text
editors to code, /make/ to compile, and shell scripts to
connect everything up.  But today -- what misery!  For each
new technology I must learn new design patterns, new
libraries, and new toolchains.  Our build process is
inflexible, the design meetings interminable, the code
reviews insulting, the testers intolerant, and the deadlines
insane."

"Then the years have been kinder to me," said Shinpuru.
"For in the days of my youth my temple was a primitive
place, where we celebrated victories that now seem laughably
small.  But today -- what bliss!  For each new technology
there are so many tools that with a little study I can
achieve what would once have been impossible.  And if our
quickening pace leads me to stumble, a dozen monks will
catch me before I fall.  You should leave your miserable
temple and come to mine."

The nun raised an eyebrow.  "My brother Shinpuru is mocking
me, for we labor side-by-side today, just as we have done
since we were children."

"Then I should escort you safely back to our abbey," said
Shinpuru.  "For your eyes are so glued to the beautiful
scenery behind you, I fear you will walk backwards off that
cliff."
