Title: Ill Met By Moonlight

At the conclusion of a presentation, Jinyu was approached by
several of her abbots.  One said, "In your talk you
mentioned the Four Types of Meeting Attendee.  What are
these?"

Jinyu counted off on her fingers:

      "Those who come to inform, //
      those who come to learn, //
      those who come to be dutiful, //
      and those who come to be noticed."

A second abbot nodded his head, saying, "Clearly we have too
few of the first and second types."

Jinyu said impatiently, "Yes, yes; I see you."
