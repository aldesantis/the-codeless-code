Three young monks -- one from the [[Spider Clan]], one from
[[Laughing Monkey Clan|Laughing Monkey]],
and one from [[Elephant's Footprint Clan|Elephant's Footprint]] --
had been arguing about which was the more
important: webtier code, business tier, or persistence.
Finally they agreed to pose the question to the Java master.

The master called in one of the burly gardeners who
maintained the temple grounds, and instructed him thus:
"Beat and kick these three monks soundly for one minute.
Afterward, you may continue to beat and kick them for as
long as you desire."

The gardener thrashed the monks for a full seven minutes,
then bowed and left.

"Now," said the master.  "Who bears the greatest blame for
your bruises today?  Myself, for summoning the gardener; the
gardener, for the six minutes left to his discretion; or the
gardener's hands and feet?  Consider your answer, or I shall
call him in again."

At length, the monk of the Spider Clan said, "The carpenter
who raised the first beam of this temple bears a greater
blame."

The master was satisfied.
