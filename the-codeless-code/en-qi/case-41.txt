Illus.0.title: It's probably for the best that it fades out below.

Java master [[Suku]] was investigating the
software of a distant temple.  On her monitor large swaths
of text glowed not black but green, indicating that reams of
code had been commented out.

"Curious," said Suku.  "I have opened a fine clock, and
discovered orange rinds and fish bones."

The head monk explained that the inactive code was no longer
necessary, yet he had ordered his clan to leave it in place:
for if it someday became desirable to restore the logic then the
code could simply be uncommented, rather than wastefully
written from scratch.

"Understandable," nodded Suku.

The next day the monks assembled again for the Java master's
inspection.  With concern they reported that the head monk
could not be found.  Suku gestured up into the rafters where
the missing monk dangled from a strong rope, by the neck.  A
foul odor wafted downwards.

"Your head monk's services are no longer necessary," said
Suku.  "Yet let his corpse moulder above you from
this day forward.  After all, his methods may someday become
desirable again, and it would be wasteful to train another
monk from scratch."

In her final report, Suku noted a swift change in the clan's
coding practices, and credited the good example set by the
deceased head monk.  <i>We should consider his
reinstatement,</i> she wrote.
