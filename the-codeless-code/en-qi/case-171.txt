Illus.0.title: Does anyone else think it's weird that the universal search icon is a magnifying glass?  When was the last time you searched for *anything* with a magnifiying glass in real life?  My ideal search icon would be a little picture of me, screaming "HAS ANYONE SEEN MY CAR KEYS?!"


The nun [[Hwídah]] was summoned to the offices of master
[[Banzen]].  She found the master waiting with his
apprentice [[Djishin]] in attendance.

Banzen said, "A happy day for you, little nun!  Since you
take such pleasure in learning hidden truths and seeing
guilty parties corrected, I have an entertaining task for you."

"I serve at the pleasure of the Temple, not my own," Hwídah
replied with a dutiful bow.  But her stomach was already
clenched; for no doubt this was the start of her
punishment for [[#152|trespassing on forbidden Temple ground.]]

"An infrequent but stubborn error has plagued the
[[Elephant's Footprint Clan]] for some time now," said the
master as he handed the nun a printout.  "Our database logs
show this malformed SQL query, yet a thorough
search of our code base reveals no such query anywhere.
Find the source.  I give you one week."

Hwídah studied the paper.  "A few minutes should suffice.
May I borrow the master's terminal?"

Banzen's eyebrows shot up.  He exchanged glances with his
apprentice, then slid his laptop toward the nun.

Hwídah consulted the printout, typed something, scrutinized
the screen, consulted the printout again, and so on several
times over.  "There," she said finally, turning the screen
around.  The cursor was indeed hovering over a SQL fragment
with a missing right parenthesis.  "If I return to my
workstation, I can trace this code to its consumers and
reproduce the error seen in the logs.  Then we may repair
the defect with confidence."

"Go," said Banzen to Hwídah.
To his apprentice he said: "Observe."

As the pair walked to Hwídah's cubicle, Djishin whispered,
"The speed of your diagnosis was surprising."

"A simple matter," said Hwídah, handing the printout to the
monk.  "The malformed query begins with <tt>WHERE 1=1</tt>.
That has the stink of dynamically-generated SQL -- for
although the initial condition is trivial, its <tt>TRUE</tt>
value allows a developer to append any number of
/real/ conditions as simple <tt>AND</tt> clauses.  I have
used this technique myself when implementing search forms
with optional fields.  Once I recognized it, I merely
searched our code for the individual <tt>AND</tt> clauses."

"You misunderstand me," said Djishin.  "I was not surprised
that you were /able/ to solve it immediately; I was
surprised that you did so despite being given a full week.
That has the stink of ambition -- for although this initial
problem was trivial, your ready truthfulness
now allows my master to entrust you with any number of /real/
problems."

Hwídah sighed.  "It is just as well.  If I had pretended
that this problem was difficult enough to merit days of
effort, Banzen would have thought me either deceitful or
incompetent.  Neither would sit well with me.  That is what
he truly wished to discover."

Djishin nodded.  "Sometimes a test serves a purpose
/because/ the answer is so obvious."
