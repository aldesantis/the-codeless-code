Illus.0.title: Curiously enough, the only thing that went through the mind of the rice bowl as it fell was "Oh no, not again..."

Master [[Bawan]] was assisting the [[Elephant's Footprint Clan]]
in creating a database service for the temple's audit logs.

"We shall need at least three weeks to determine which NoSQL
database engine would be best for this task," said Bawan
to the abbot of that clan.

"No need," said the abbot.  "The [[Temple of the Burning Pool]]
has recently chosen a NoSQL engine for their own purposes.
Follow the path they have taken.  We shall save much time."

The master flung his bowl hard at the abbot's head.  The
abbot ducked, and the bowl sailed harmlessly out the
tower window.

"See what your infamous temper has cost you, little master!"
laughed the abbot.  "Now you have lost your bowl, and it is
nearly time to line up for supper!"

In one swift motion, Bawan flung the abbot out the window.
Then he turned to the pair of astonished novices still in the room.

"The abbot is following the path my bowl has taken,"
explained the master.  "Come; perhaps he will save us a
place in line."
