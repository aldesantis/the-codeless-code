A novice studied the Java master's{{*}} code and adopted the
master's style to an exacting degree: the design patterns
employed, the naming conventions for variables, the number
of spaces used to indent each nested block.  Even the
comments were written in an impressive imitation of the
master's own voice.

During his next code review, the novice was surprised to
find the Java master tremendously displeased.

"But, master," protested the student.  "I have followed your
example down to the final semicolon.  See, here is a utility
class you wrote only last month: is it not as like to my own
code as two eggs from the same clutch?"

"And therein lies the problem," scowled the
master. "Yesterday I was a fool, the week before an idiot,
and last month an imbecile.  Don't show me code I might
have written yesterday.  Show me code as I will write it
tomorrow."


{{*}} Probably [[Banzen]].
