After the nun [[Satou]] had [[#221|corrected her code,]]
she returned to Java master [[Banzen]] and asked that he
review it.

"So," said Banzen, squinting at the latest revision.
"You /now/ obtain your 'hash of the pages contents'
by taking the byte-array that holds those contents
and sending it into /Arrays.hashCode()/."

"Will that not work?" asked Satou nervously.

"It will function adequately in this circumstance," said
Banzen.  "However, if your 'hash of the page contents' is meant
to be a digest, then you should use a utility that
/calculates/ a digest."

"But if my code functions adequately, and makes use of what
I have on hand, then what is the advantage of such a
change?" asked Satou.

The master glared.  "Stand in that corner, with your elbows
at your sides and your thumbs up," said Banzen.
"And remain quiet until you are enlightened!"

Satou glumly stood in the corner as she was told.  The
master typed something into his phone, then sat back in his
chair and fell silent as well.

Seconds later, a temple guard who had been standing watch
for hours in the snow burst into Banzen's offices, his knife
at the ready and his spectacles fogged from the sudden
change in temperature.

"Forgive my summons, old friend!" said the master "There is
no emergency.  Please, make yourself comfortable and I will
explain."

The guard removed his fur cloak and draped it on Satou's head.
When he heard her muffled cry he jumped backwards with a start,
knife raised.

"That is not your usual coat stand!" exclaimed the guard.

"No," said Banzen,  "But it functions adequately,
and makes use of what I had on hand."
