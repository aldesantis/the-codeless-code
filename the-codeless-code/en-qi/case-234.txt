The nun [[Hwídah]] has composed this uncharacteristically
somber sonnet for your contemplation:

     I chanced upon an ancient cache of code:       //
     a stack of printouts, tall as any man,         //
     that in decaying boxes had been stowed.        //
     Ten thousand crumbling pages long it ran.      //
     Abandoned in the blackness to erode,           //
     what steered a ship through blackness to the moon. //
     The language is unused in this late year.      //
     The target hardware, likewise, lies in ruin.   //
     Entombed within one lone procedure's scope,    //
     a line of code and then these words appear:    //
                                                    //
     <tt># TEMPORARY, I HOPE HOPE HOPE</tt>         //
                                                    //
     The code beside persisting to the last --      //
     as permanent as aught upon this sphere --      //
     while overhead, a vacant moon flies past.      //

== Editor's note

Inspired by <a href="http://qz.com/726338/the-code-that-took-america-to-the-moon-was-just-published-to-github-and-its-like-a-1960s-time-capsule/">this story</a> of the Apollo Guidance Computer code for Apollo 11,
and
<a href="https://github.com/chrislgarry/Apollo-11/blob/master/Luminary099/LUNAR_LANDING_GUIDANCE_EQUATIONS.agc#L179">this code within</a>,
and Percy Bysshe Shelley's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozymandias">Ozymandias</a> of course.

I tried to keep to Shelley's unusual (and non-standard)
rhyme scheme for the sonnet, but I departed from it in the
second-to-last line for poetic reasons.  For a language
which excels in stealing words from other cultures, English
has an appalling lack of rhymes.
