Two monks came to the Java master with very different
implementation strategies for a particular project.  Each
presented their case with passion and conviction.

After some consideration, the master told them to divide up
the subsystems.  Each monk would take half and proceed
with their preferred strategy.

The first monk protested: "For any given problem, is there
not often one solution which is superior?"

The second monk was equally unhappy: "And even if the
superior choice is unclear, is it not generally better to
proceed consistently, and thus avoid chaos?"

"Yes," said the Java master.  "Were neither of you paying
attention?"
