On Monday a monk was sent to master [[Kaimu]] to inquire,
"What is the greatest peril of caching?"

Kaimu answered, "Monday is my busiest day.  Ask again
tomorrow and I will teach you all I know."

On Tuesday the monk returned and asked the same question.

Kaimu answered, "Monday is my busiest day.  Ask again
tomorrow and I will teach you all I know."



== Qi's commentary

If the monk had asked a different question, he would have learned nothing.


== Qi's poem

Eku asked why Mugen was rude to the shopkeeper. //
Mugen said: That shopkeeper once sold me a broken shovel. //
Eku dumped a bucket of water on Mugen's head -- //
She explained: Last year my house was on fire. //
