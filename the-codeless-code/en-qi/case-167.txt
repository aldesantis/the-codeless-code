Old master [[Banzen]] had volunteered to mentor the [[Spider Clan]]
during master Suku's [[#33|travels]], but as the months dragged on
the experience had worn his nerves quite thin.  In one critical
application, the components written by different developers were
somehow stepping on each other, leading to strange runtime errors.

In desperation, Banzen procured a bottle of huangjiu
[[#93|from master Bawan]],
downed half of it, and summoned his apprentice [[Djishin]].

A week later, Djishin reported on his progress:

"Our problem lies with the Java servlet's /session/ and
/request/ contexts, where we store data for state and
rendering.  These contexts are HashMaps whose values are
Objects and whose keys are Strings of the developer's
choosing.  Since each developer has chosen their keys
without consulting their peers, one component will sometimes
overwrite the context values used by another -- often with
an object of an entirely different type."

"What solution, then?" asked Banzen, uncorking his bottle.

"I have created a shared ContextUtil class with sixty String
constants, one for every context key used across the
application," said Djishin proudly.  "And for each key I
have provided a pair of strongly-typed static utility methods
to /get/ or /set/ that key's value in a given context."

"Much like property methods," observed Banzen.

"Exactly!" said Djishin.  "I am currently devising a
namespace convention for keys so that each subsystem may
have its /own/ ContextUtil class, providing additional
constants and static methods as needed."

"Much like subclasses," observed Banzen.

"Exactly!" said Djishin again.

"Excellent," said Banzen, draining his cup.  "So in seven
days, by using only simple constants and functions operating
on a generic Java hashtable, we have invented... the Object."
