A nun found the scribe [[Qi]] in his study.

"I am puzzled by the comments you have written on my
documentation," said the nun, placing a thick sheaf of
papers on the scribe's desk.

"Ah, yes," said Qi as he turned the pages, revealing
hundreds of neatly-rendered sequence diagrams, each with a
small note scrawled upon it in red ink.  "You are the nun
who graphically illustrates every possible circumstance in
which a domain object is retrieved and displayed, regardless
of how intuitive the case may seem."

"I strive to be thorough," said the nun.

"That is a great relief," said the scribe. "If
you were striving to be concise, I shudder to
imagine what your thoroughness would do
to the local tree population."

The nun tapped her finger on the red scrawl at the
bottom of one page.  "Yet under each diagram you
have written, <i>this picture speaks 1000 words</i>."

"That number is in base two," said the scribe.

The nun blinked.  <i>"Eight</i> words?"

Qi nodded, dipping his brush in a pot of red ink.
"The same eight, over and over: <i>This nun owns a tool
for generating UML</i>."
