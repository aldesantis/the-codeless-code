Master [[Bawan]] posed this dilemma to the developers
in his charge:

"When investigating strange behavior in the production
environment, our most powerful weapon has always been debug
messages: the more numerous and detailed, the better.  Yet
when used copiously, the formatting of such messages becomes
expensive -- /needlessly/ expensive, for we exclude debug
messages from our logs when we are not 
investigating problems.  So which path is best?  Safe but
slow, or heedless but fast?"

<i>"Wú,"</i> said one of the nuns.  "Everything may be
logged, with minimal expense.  Wrap every /debug/ call
within an /if/ statement which verifies that debugging is on
before bothering to format the message.  We will only be
slow when we need to be safe."

Bawan considered this, and seemed pleased.
He bade the nun implement her approach in an application
that was presently being designed.  As further reward for
her cleverness he presented her with two enamel boxes.

"Open the red box immediately," said Bawan, "but leave the
black box shut tight.  In time it will serve you."

Inside the red box the nun discovered a small bowl full of
succulent kiwi fruit, lychee, and white pears, resting on a
bed of goji berries.  These she enjoyed greatly that
very evening.  Afterwards she placed both boxes on a high
shelf, and eventually forgot about them.

Two years later, after the system had undergone several
enhancements, a minor production problem appeared --
the first in many releases.  The nun requested that the
system be restarted in debug mode.

Suddenly, stack traces from NullPointerExceptions appeared
on the screens of every user.  The system had become completely
unusable.  As the nun stood aghast amid the chaos,
master Bawan sidled up to her and whispered, "Now fetch the
black box."

When the lid was lifted a foul odor issued forth.  Inside
lay a small bowl filled with the mouldy, dessicated remains
of what appeared to have once been kiwi fruit, lychee, pears and
goji berries.

The nun requested that debug mode be turned off
and then closed the box, enlightened.
