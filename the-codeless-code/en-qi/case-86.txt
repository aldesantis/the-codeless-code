Master [[Banzen]] was investigating the novices of a distant
abbey.  Their designs and implementations caused him much disquiet.

"Who reviews your code?" asked Banzen.

"Our masters have us review each other's code," explained one
of the novices.  "This leaves them free for more important duties."

"Indeed," said Banzen.  He hurled his staff hard across the
room to the abbey's fusebox, which burst apart in a shower of sparks.
All the screens went dark.

Banzen retrieved his staff, saying: "Now their electrons are
free as well."
