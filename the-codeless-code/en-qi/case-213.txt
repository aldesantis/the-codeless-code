<i>This week young master Zjing was reviewing the code of the
[[Elephant's Footprint Clan]], whose monks were called upon
to design database tables, create triggers, and build the
persistence layers of the Temple's applications.</i>

- - -

On Monday she saw a table named CustomerAddress, //
designed to hold the address of a Customer. //
It had eight columns suited for this task.

Likewise she found a /class/ named CustomerAddress, //
which had eight corresponding properties. //
/All is as it should be,/ thought the master.

On Tuesday she saw a table named BusinessAddress,  //
designed to hold the address of a Business. //
It had nine columns suited for this task.

Likewise she found a /class/ named BusinessAddress, //
which had nine corresponding properties. //
/Just as I expected/, thought the master.

On Wednesday she saw a table named RegimentAddress, //
designed to hold the address of a Regiment. //
It had ten columns suited for this task.

Likewise she sought a /class/ named RegimentAddress, //
which had ten corresponding properties, //
but no such class was found --

    And while there was a class named Regiment, //
    its address was kept in a BusinessAddress, //
    where 'street' now held three unrelated fields, //

    and 'postalCode' the 'baseNumber', //
    and 'suite' the 'barracksNumber'. //
    /Welcome to my nightmare,/ thought the master.

On Thursday she located the developer //
who had declined to implement a RegimentAddress. //
She asked him to explain his rationale.

Reuse, the monk said proudly: //
for is it not better to have less code to manage? //
/Simple novice error,/ thought the master.

On Friday she checked the monk's code again, //
for she had advised him on the virtues of consistency, //
and was eager to see his progress.

Once more she sought a class named RegimentAddress, //
which had the ten expected properties, //
but no such class was found --

    Indeed, now BusinessAddress was gone, //
    and CustomerAddress too.  And in their place, //
    one Address class with /twenty/ properties --

    crossing all three 'Address' tables, //
    doomed forever to be partially filled. //
    /EXPLETIVE DELETED/, thought the master.

On Saturday she sat by a pond, //
regarded the reflection of three maple trees, //
and thought:

Three trees above, three trees below. //
This mindless pond //
has more good sense than that monk.
