Title: Out of the Zone

The nun [[Zjing]] had a well-known [[#54|fear of heights]].
For this reason she lived in the valley far below the mountaintop
temple, and had only braved the treacherous cliffside paths
[[#136|but once]].  Through webcams, phone and IM she had maintained
an effective telepresence in the Temple.

So it was with some trepidation that she received this email
from master [[Banzen]] on the evening of the longest night
of winter:

  An important Temple matter has arisen, and I desire your
  confidential input.

  My schedule has an opening tomorrow when the dawn bell is struck.
  We may converse electronically if you so desire, but I would prefer
  to speak in person in my office.

  B.


In darkness Zjing dutifully ascended the first of the steep
stairs that had been hewn out of the mountain walls.  Higher
and higher she climbed, trying hard not to let her gaze fall
to the wintry foothills below.  Snowdrifts blocked her path;
she scrambled over them.  Rope bridges creaked underfoot;
she crossed them.  Great moonlit icicles trembled overhead,
tall as trees, sharp as spears, threatening to fall at the
slightest whisper; she edged past them without a sound.
Howling winds threatened to tear her off the foot-wide path
and return her to the valley quickly and permanently; she
clung to the rock face and forced herself to continue,
hand-hold by miserable hand-hold.

At the last echo of the dawn bell, Zjing appeared
at Banzen's door.  She bowed and entered, betraying no emotion.

Banzen closed the door behind her.  "I have just heard from
master [[Suku]]," he said.  "Although she was to return to us
this winter, she has decided instead to remain in the
Far Provinces."

"Does she no longer love our Temple?" asked Zjing.

"It is /because/ she loves our Temple that she will not
return yet," said the master.  "She has found her travels to
be surprisingly edifying, both for herself and her
apprentices.  True, they are weary and weathered, and the
comforts of home would be most welcome now.  But there is
much more to teach and to learn.  If Suku extends her
travels, all will benefit greatly in the end."

"This past year has been most difficult for the [[Spider Clan]]
without her guidance," said Zjing.

"Indeed," agreed Banzen. "A replacement must be trained.
As a senior nun of that clan, I called you here to learn
who you would suggest."

"Can one /train/ a monk to be a master?"

Banzen chuckled.  "Did you think that I was born with this
title?  In our Temple, /master/ is not an honorific, but a
verb disguised as an adjective.  The candidate becomes by
learning, and learns by doing."

Zjing pondered the many senior monks she knew.
All had virtues to speak of, but vices as well.
"What qualities are you most looking for in such a
candidate?" she asked at last.

"The first quality is the very same that Suku herself has
just demonstrated," said Banzen.  He walked over to his
window and gazed across the gorge.  The thin light of dawn
was just now illuminating the last few zig-zags of the steep,
terrible path up from the valley.  "The first quality is a
willingness to leave one's comfort zone when duty calls."
