A monk asked Java master [[Kaimu]]: //
What is the "single-responsibility principle"?

Said Kaimu: //
That a class shall do exactly one thing, //
and do it completely.

The monk asked: //
How shall I decide this "one thing"?

Said Kaimu: //
The Fisherman does not build ships, //
or we would call him a Shipwright.

The monk asked: //
Is there no room in your philosophy for interfaces? //
What if my class can serve as a Fisherman, //
and a Shipwright and Sailor besides?

Said Kaimu: //
What would you name such a three-headed monster?

The monk replied: //
Shísho, after my uncle.  He lives by the sea and does all these things.

Said Kaimu: //
I would give your class Shísho three instance variables: //
a Fisherman, a Shipwright, and a Sailor. //
Then Shísho may implement those interfaces by delegation.

The monk replied: //
I speak of inheritance, yet you answer in composition. //
/All/ of my uncle is a Fisherman, not just his left foot. //
What use are objects, if we do not faithfully model the world?

Said Kaimu: //
If I paint a fine shark upon this page, will you say, "Fine shark!" //
or will you complain that it is flat and does not eat you? //

The monk asked: //
But how are we to know when the flat shark is shark enough? //
Or when our uncle should fish with his left foot?

Said Kaimu: //
Learning how is /our/ "single reponsibility".


== Qi's Commentary

Every class does exactly one thing -- //
but sometimes that one thing //
is "doing too many things".


== Qi's Poem

One morning Kaimu took up his brush. //
In two strokes he painted an exquisite shark. //
A passerby laughed. "It is a poor shark that can't open its mouth!" //
Kaimu replied, "Even so, it has told me that you are a fool."
