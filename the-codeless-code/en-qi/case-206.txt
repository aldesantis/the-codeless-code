A monk emailed master [[Kaimu]]:

      Last week you hinted at Six Qualities //
      essential to being a diligent developer. //
      What are these "Six Qualities"?


Strangely, within seconds he received a long reply:

      To understand music, //
      visit the raucous market at noon. //
      To understand the Six Qualities, //
      you have only to look around you:

      The First is lacking in the monk [[Mudána]]. //
      If asked to hunt a deer for supper, //
      he will spend the day in bed dreaming of venison. //
      We gave him leave to rest all day -- far away from here.

      The Second is lacking in the nun [[Nabasu]]. //
      If asked to hunt a deer for supper, //
      she will cringe as if the bow were a pit-viper, //
      and beg to be relieved of the duty.

      The Third is lacking in the monk [[Djishin]]. //
      If asked to hunt a deer for supper, //
      he will [[#108|try to invent a weapon]] for the task. //
      That week the Temple will go hungry.

      The Fourth is lacking in the monk [[Landhwa]]. //
      If asked to hunt a deer for supper, //
      he will [[#97|drop his bow and haul along a cannon]], //
      leaving us with little meat, and a large mess.

      The Fifth is lacking in the monk [[Wangohan]]. //
      If asked to hunt a deer for supper, //
      he will choose the shuriken [[#194|against all objections]], //
      and chase a bleeding deer for thirty days.

      The Sixth is lacking in young master [[Zjing]]. //
      If asked to hunt a deer for supper, //
      she will promise to do so when she has a free moment... //
      The deer will be dead of ripe old age by then.


The monk thought for a minute and emailed the master:

      The First is too lazy to even begin. //
      The Second too lazy to conquer self-doubt. //
      The Third is too lazy to look for good tools. //
      The Fourth is too lazy to strive for precision. //
      The Fifth is too lazy to start over fresh. //
      The Sixth is too lazy to focus attention. //

      Yet if laziness engenders six paths to failure, //
      how can it be one of the Three Great Virtues?{{*}} //


Again, within seconds he received a reply:

      Master Kaimu is away on a deer hunting trip. //
      When asked to answer emails during his absence, //
      he decided to code a slick auto-responder instead. //
      If you're reading this, rephrase and resend your question.
