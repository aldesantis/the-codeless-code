Even on the best of days the monk [[Wangohan|Wangohan's]] mood would
rival old vinegar, but the long bleak winter had soured it
still more.  Many were the target of his scorn, but none
moreso than the monk [[Landhwa]]:

"His lazyiness is no secret," Wangohan complained to one
poor novice at mealtime (who all-too-late understood why the
seats near Wangohan were always empty), "yet from his
masters he receives no correction.  He presents the
/illusion/ of being industrious but in truth he is coding
his own pet projects.  I asked him to implement a dozen
simple DAOs; he chafed at the tediousness of the task,
then wasted a week developing a DAO-code-generator to spit
them out!"

When the gong called the brothers back to their cubicles,
a senior monk pulled the novice aside.

"What impression have you of our brother Wangohan?" grinned
the senior monk.  "Surely you have something to say on this
matter, unless he has truly talked your head off."

The novice thought a moment.

"Wangohan has the spirit of the mule: dedicated and
hard-laboring," said the novice.  "I would trust him to
carry ten thousand stones from the valley to the temple."

"High praise," said the senior monk.

"Is it?" asked the novice.  "His rival Landhwa would first
build a wheelbarrow."
