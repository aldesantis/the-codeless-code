<i>To mark the solemn occasion of the two-hundredth case
being entered into the annals of the Temple, I asked the nun
Yíwen to prepare for me a long, informative, and
heavily-footnoted treatise on the history of the Boolean
data type.  To my dismay I received this bit of doggerel
instead.  Many apologies to those of you who came here seeking
edification. -- Qi.</i>

You might //
not know //
that long //
ago

most words, //
when new, //
came two //
by two:


        you / me, //
        aye / nay, //
        he / she, //
        we / they,

        girl / boy, //
        yang / yin, //
        grief / joy, //
        out / in.


This is, //
you see, //
our ten- //
dency --

treat all //
in sight //
as black //
or white:


        yes / no, //
        old / new, //
        stop / go, //
        false / true,

        live / dead, //
        here / gone, //
        tail / head, //
        off / on.


No place //
halfway. //
No shades //
of gray.

Just hit //
or miss. //
Just that //
or this:


        strong / frail, //
        smile / frown, //
        pass / fail, //
        up / down, //

        quick / slow, //
        luck / fate, //
        high / low, //
        love / hate.


But if //
you dare //
to look //
with care --

to stare //
foursquare

//

at each allegedly opposing pair, //

//

fully aware //
you must distrust your every instinct, and forswear //
that inborn, impulsive tendency //
to impose binary simplicity --

then eventually //
you may see

that almost nothing //
is wholly one thing or another.

For words -- like floats and ints and bools -- //
are merely tools,

providing only crude approximation //
for the facilitation of communication.

And any string of words, however nice, //
at best is imprecise,

while at worst may be tragically misleading //
(and that includes the sentence you're currently reading).

//

So here's //
my rule:

<i>don't think //
in bool.</i>

Leave cer- //
tainty //
to cir- //
cuitry

(unless //
you trust //
the world //
is just ...


        sane / mad, //
        short / long, //
        good / bad, //
        right / wrong, //

        left / right, //
        all / none, //
        day / night, //
        oh / one).
