The nun [[Satou]] approached master [[Kaimu]] and said, "My
master spoke of a First Mantra which must guide the thoughts of
Temple developers at all times.  What is this mantra?"

Kaimu answered, <i>"I create.</i>  The essence of
developer-nature is to be always in the process of
creation when one is at a keyboard."

Satou arched an eyebrow suspiciously and asked,
"If I merely fix defects, what am I creating?"

Kaimu answered, "Harmony."

Satou asked, "If I refactor yet preserve behavior, what am I creating?"

Kaimu answered, "Order."

Satou asked, "If I delete an unused project, what am I creating?"

Kaimu answered, "Disk space."

Satou asked, "If I do nothing but browse the web, what am I creating?"

Kaimu answered, "Missed deadlines, and a job opening."
