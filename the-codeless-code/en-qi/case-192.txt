Illus.0.title: This same monk would later invent Post-It notes.

[[#191|This same monk]] maintained a site
that sold agricultural tools to local farmers.  It lately had
caused these farmers much frustration, so the monk
resolved to follow master [[Bawan]]'s advice and offer the
[[#191|Four Words of Distress]] to his users as quickly as
possible.  For when an angry farmer wants to get his point
across to a developer, that point is usually at the tip of a
scythe.

The monk devoted his first sprint to providing /Help/
buttons throughout the interface, implemented as links into
the online user manual.  This, he thought, would take the
least time and effort -- and besides, farmers should
appreciate the value of low-hanging fruit.

But soon after deployment the monk found a note stuck into
his door, on the business end of an axe:

     Drowning, I cried out to your boat for Help. //
     You threw a heavy tome and rowed away.  //
     A friendly voice was all the rope I needed -- //
     Now I crave the sort that makes a noose.

The monk devoted his second sprint to providing /Cancel/
buttons throughout the interface, so that any action
of importance would only proceed after confirmation.

But soon after deployment the monk found a second note stuck
into his door, this one on the tines of a pitchfork:

     When asked, /Do you truly wish to cancel your order?/  //
     my only choices were /OK/ and /Cancel/.  //
     I chose Cancel, yet received ten thousand pitchforks --  //
     I shall send one to your posterior... OK?

- - -

The monk devoted his third sprint to providing an
ever-present /Undo/ button, so that any action could be
reversed.  This took the greatest time and effort, yet he
was well-pleased with the result.

But soon after deployment the monk found a third note stuck
to his door, this one held fast by garden-spikes:

     A penitent man cries, <i>what have I done?</i> //
     Merciful gods vow to turn back time. //
     A cricket chirps.  All else is still -- //
     Now the man cries: <i>what have I <b>un</b>-done?</i>

That evening Bawan informed the monk that a line of
townsfolk had been seen advancing up the mountain, holding
various farm implements which glinted in the setting sun.

The monk declared, "Three of your Four Words have failed me!"

The master replied, "Eku had a parrot that repeated her
words faithfully, but no one went to the parrot for wisdom."

"How can I placate my users?" asked the monk.

"The parrot placated Eku's cat at dinner-time," said Bawan.

"There is still the Fourth Word of Distress," said the monk.
"Can /it/ save me?"

"Only if you invoke it yourself," said Bawan.

The monk hit the /Off/ button on his workstation and fled the
mountain forever.
